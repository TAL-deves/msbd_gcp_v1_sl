He hails from lineages of meditation adepts from Himalaya who are known for their combination of rishi sagely scholarship and nātha yogic practices. Deep meditation on the Sanskrit verses of cardinal philosophies and monastic inquiry methods led to his profound realization. His Holiness teaches cardinal philosophies with exquisite clarity directly from the original Sanskrit literature.",
