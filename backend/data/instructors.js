      "D. Almasur Rahman is a highly realized siddha monk who reveals to us a Himalayan tradition of higher yoga based on his tutelage within the Sanskrit heritage. He hails from lineages of meditation adepts from Himalaya who are known for their combination of rishi sagely scholarship and nƒÅtha yogic practices. Deep meditation on the Sanskrit verses of cardinal philosophies and monastic inquiry methods led to his profound realization. His Holiness teaches cardinal philosophies with exquisite clarity directly from the original Sanskrit literature.",
